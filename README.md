# Explore-US-Bikeshare-Data
Project summary: Bike Share Data Analysis Bicycle-sharing systems have become increasingly popular in cities worldwide, providing a convenient and eco-friendly transportation option. With the rise of information technologies, itâ€™s now easier than ever for users to access and return bikes, while also generating valuable data on usage patterns.

In this project, I analyzed data from Motivate, a leading bike share system provider in the United States, to uncover usage patterns in three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Project description: The project required the ability to import and analyze large datasets to answer interesting questions and compute descriptive statistics.

Solution: I developed a Python-based solution with the following features:
1- The ability to import bike share data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

2- The ability to compute descriptive statistics and answer interesting questions about the data.

3- An interactive script that creates an engaging user experience in the terminal.

4- Clear and concise presentation of statistics.

My solution provided valuable insights into bike share usage in major cities, enabling data-driven decision making and planning. With my strong analytical skills and expertise in Python, I was able to deliver a high-quality analysis that can help guide future developments in bike share systems.
